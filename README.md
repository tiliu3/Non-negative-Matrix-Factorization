R package to perform Non-negative Matrix Factorization
based on multiplicative updates (Lee and Seung2001), alternating least squares and multinomial algorithms;
Credit also to Lars Kai Hansen’s nnmf_als Matlab implementation, Torsten Hothorn’s Moore-Penrose inverse function.

My R package has been quoted in a number of academic publication(s) including
